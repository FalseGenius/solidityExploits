## Solidity Exploits

**A repo covering some exploits**

---

### Attacks covered so far,

**Reentrancy:** Creating a malicious contract with a twisted fallback() that
takes advantage of external calls in a target contract.

**External Contract Referencing:** Setting up a contract and passing it, through constructor and/or a function, address of a contract with similar name and function signatures but different functionality.

**DoS:** Rendering a transaction useless, exploiting unbounded for-loops, or external calls, or other reason to make transaction fail for users.

Note: *For DOS, ask if the iterative loop is bounded to a certain size or not? Does it have external calls? If yes, what would make the call fail? If they do fail, would that cause a revert? If yes, that's a potential DoS! Can it affect the system?*
